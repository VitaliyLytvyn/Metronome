# Metronome

Metronome application. Used M-V-P pattern. Configuration changes does not affect the app, so when the app running a device can be rotated.

Options that can be choosen(added/removed), in tact to the simple indicator: Sound, Vibration, Torch.

Both the state and the work, persists over configuration changes and even explicit exit from the appliction. Thus to abort implementation the "STOP" button should be pushed down.

A tune can be choosen from menu.
